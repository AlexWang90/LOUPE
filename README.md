# End-to-End Pooling (E2EP) Tensorflow Toolbox

E2EP is a Tensorflow toolbox that efficiently implements several learnable pooling method such as NetVLAD,
NetRVLAD, NetFV and Soft-DBoF as well as the Context Gating activation from: 
Miech et al., Learnable pooling method with Context Gating for video classification, arXiv.
